# QuadTree
#### Quad trees are extremely useful when dealing with large amounts of interconnected data.
It is used for image compression, maps services, collision detection and much more.
> This program uses my own implementation of a Quad Tree to test for collisions between 1000 objects while maintaing 120fps+.  
> Like any traditional quad tree it hold 4 nodes that is used to recursively add to or clear a collection of points.  

You could further extened points to hold data for various shapes or you could just implement your own range checking algorithm to retrieve and store data.
